Thoroughly understand the application architecture and goal and provide improvements and implementations as requested. The project is a node based graph builder that can be used to abstractly define the dataflow of a system strictly done in terms of calculations or any form of processing made possible by computing. Users can create various node types depending on the function required. The raw input node abstractly shows the data node that will be used to identify the data setup for processing. The raw input data can for example be a cell in an excel sheet after the json file is parsed, the cell should have the node label as the header above the cell indicating where the user can drop the actual values they need processed. The calculation node takes uses its incoming connections to reference the nodes the user will selection some form of calculation on. For example a calculation node can have a raw input node, a conditional node and another calculation node each which will be passing their own reference. The raw input node simply represents the reference to the abstract value it is labeled as. The conditional node will pass the same value that is input into it, the purpose is to apply different routes of processing based on the true false value of the condition applied, the calculation node itself applies calculations/processing on any input references it has incoming and outputs a reference to the result which essentially for example would be a cell in an excel sheet with formula plugged with references to cells or ranges that it will apply the formula to. All these functionalities are purely abstract, the node builder simply acts as a dataflow diagram with the capability of outputting the graph in json format that will contain all nodes and connections made including the labels, conditions and processing functions. you will at a later time work on a backend that will process the json file into an excel template but for now implement and verify that all the aforementioned functionalities with robust code implementation and object oriented manner. Here is the starting point of the code:
